##<a name="section1"></a>Introduction

There is a GUI governing both the storage and the computing cluster (in future releases, it will be fully integrated with Sahara's dashboard as well). Through this GUI the users will be able to create an account, i.e. a HDFS userspace for storing data, and access to the computing resources for running MapReduce applications.

Fully detailed information about Cosmos GUI can be found at [Github](http://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-cosmos/tree/develop/cosmos-gui).
